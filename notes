okay, so I need a way to tie rendered html card elements to the js object that created them. right now, I have a renderCard object that creates a div from a given card object. I think what I actually need is two arrays of objects. one for the deck and one for the table. and then I have a deal function that moves cards from the deck to the table. and then I have a render function that renders the table array in html.

and then I need a way that, when a card is clicked, it gives its object a "selected" state. and the same rendering function from above will loop through the the table array and give the "selected" class to the cards that have the "selected state".

okay, so steps to make this happen
- create deck[] and table[]
- create deal()
- create render()
